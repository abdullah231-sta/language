# Voice Activity Detection Fix Summary

## Problem
Voice avatar indicators (green glow and microphone icon) were only working for the group owner instead of all users at the table.

## Root Cause Analysis
The Agora SDK volume indicator might not be reporting all users consistently, or might not include users who are silent.

## Implemented Fixes

### 1. Enhanced Volume Detection (`lib/agoraVoice.ts`)
- Added comprehensive logging to track volume indicator data
- Enhanced volume indicator to track all participants
- Ensured non-speaking users are explicitly reported as not speaking
- Added local user ID tracking to include the current user in voice detection

### 2. Debug Logging Added
- **VoiceContext**: Logs speaking detection callbacks with user IDs
- **AgoraVoiceService**: Logs volume indicator data with levels and speaking status
- **MemberAvatar**: Logs each avatar's user ID and speaking status for debugging

### 3. Voice Activity Logic Improvements
- Track all remote users via `remoteAudioTracks` map
- Report non-speaking status for users not in volume report
- Include local user in voice activity tracking
- Maintain speaking threshold of volume level > 5

## Testing Instructions

1. **Join voice channel with multiple users**
2. **Check browser console for debug logs**:
   - Volume indicator data showing all users
   - Speaking detection callbacks
   - MemberAvatar logs showing user IDs and speaking status

3. **Test voice indicators**:
   - Speak into microphone
   - Check if green glow appears on your avatar
   - Check if other users see the indicators
   - Verify microphone icon animation

## Debug Console Commands

```javascript
// Check current speaking users
console.log('Current speaking users:', Array.from(voiceState.speakingUsers));

// Monitor voice state updates
window.addEventListener('voiceStateUpdate', (e) => {
  console.log('Voice state changed:', e.detail);
});
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix
- Voice activity indicators work for ALL users at the table, not just owner
- Green border glow appears when any user speaks
- Microphone icon with animation shows on speaking user's avatar
- All users see the same voice activity indicators in real-time

## Files Modified
- `lib/agoraVoice.ts` - Enhanced volume detection and user tracking
- `context/VoiceContext.tsx` - Added debug logging for speaking detection
- `components/MemberAvatar.tsx` - Added debug logging for avatar voice status

## Next Steps
1. Test with multiple users in voice channel
2. Verify debug logs show correct data
3. Remove debug logging once confirmed working
4. Test edge cases (users joining/leaving during voice activity)
